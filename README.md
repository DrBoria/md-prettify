### How Does This Magic Trick Work? ðŸª„

MD Prettify is your escape hatch from the chaos of ugly code and petty debates. 
Itâ€™s a **Visual Studio Code extension** that lets you prettify your source codeâ€”visually transforming it into something cleaner and more stylishâ€”without changing a single character of the actual file. 
Think of it as a makeover for your codebase: all the glamour, none of the refactoring drama.

### Commands

The following commands are available for keybinding:
* `mdPrettify.enablePrettySymbols`: Flip the magic ON globally.
* `mdPrettify.disablePrettySymbols`: Kill the vibe (why tho?).
* `mdPrettify.togglePrettySymbols`: Switch it up whenever you feel like it!
